            "transit": "From point A to point B: MTR: The closest MTR station is Mong Kok Station (Exit C4), located one minute away from the flat. You may come out of Exit C4 and walk two streets west on Argyle Road. That is Shanghai Street. The flat is on that corner. You may purchase single-journey tickets or an Octopus card for convenient local travel.  Bus: Buses going to many places run up and down Nathan Road. Note that buses require exact change or Octopus payment. Taxi: There are plenty of taxis in this area. Flagfall is currently HK22. Drivers almost always remember to use the meter, but do pay attention. Also, if you plan to travel longer distances by taxi, or plan to cross the harbor, be aware that passengers are responsible for toll payments. To estimate taxi fares, you may use a site such as (URL HIDDEN) Tolls are not calculated by this site.  Foot: We like to walk unless the distance is greater than that of one MTR stop.

Please remove your shoes before you enter the flat.  3- Hot Water: To turn on the hot water, flip the switch outside the bathroom door. The water will take a few minutes to heat up.

Make sure to contact us by phone at least 30 minutes prior to arrival such that we can meet you at the flat to hand you the keys and acquaint you to the surroundings.  As this is a family business, please try your best to arrive at the apartment as early as possible. After 11:30pm as transport to the apartment is limited for us, we have to charge HKD150 to cover our taxi transport cost to and from the apartment. We are generally exhausted at the end of the day and we really would rather you arrive early and not have to charge this. Guests must wait for us OUTSIDE the building upon arrival and not enter the building without us as this causes unnecessary misunders",
